Q1: what is the relationship between the length of the maternity leave and the compensation rate?  

Answer:
after looking at the maternity leave length against compensation rates we notice no clear trend since most countries offer upward of 50% compensation regardless, but its also worth noting that most countries offer less than 200 days. therefore most points cluster in the upper left portion of the plot.
